# ABC News Web Coding Exercise

## Introduction

This exercise is designed to demonstrate how you prefer to separate and structure code. It is similar to how the current ABC News site is built.

Your task is to refactor the `DetailLayout` component with clean code practices and extensibility in mind. You may refactor in whichever way you feel is correct but ensure that you explain your reasoning and thoughts in `YOUR_NOTES.md`. **Your notes are more important than your changes**.

You do not need to implement visual changes, but you may make improvements to types, accessibility or functionality if you wish. Just be sure to note all changes (any why) in `YOUR_NOTES.md`.

### Project structure

* `src/components` - these are the common components that are used throughout the application
* `src/pages` - these are where the page templates are put together. We have a component to render Web articles and a component to render App articles (articles on the ABC app are rendered inside a webview).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors
reported in the console.
