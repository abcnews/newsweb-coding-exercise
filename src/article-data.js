	<p>New Zealand's Prime Minister has declared that a trans-Tasman travel bubble would offer "huge advantages" as both countries intensify negotiations over possibly opening borders later this year.</p>
	<p>Australia and New Zealand have earned international praise for their success containing the COVID-19 outbreak, and both governments are now seriously contemplating lifting restrictions on flights between the countries.</p>
	<p>In a historic first, Ms Ardern will tomorrow join the Australian Government's National Cabinet meeting to discuss the proposal.</p>
	<p>She told reporters in New Zealand that opening international flights over the Tasman could help kickstart the economies of both countries.</p>
	<p>"There are significant advantages to New Zealand in terms of a trans-Tasman bubble not only [in terms of] domestic tourism, but equally we have a flow of people travelling between both countries, for business purposes, trade and so on," Ms Ardern said.</p>
